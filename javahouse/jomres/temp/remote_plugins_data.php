You can also 'pre filter' property uids and property types, so instead of searching all properties, you can tell the system to only return properties that fall into a group that you have already selected.

The full list of options are by_stars, by_price, by_features, by_country, by_region, by_town, by_roomtype, by_propertytype and by_guestnumber, by_date.
