This release contains a quick fix to address problems that some people were seeing with blank pages on upgrade. Note : If you have the NGM Popular, NGM Random or NGM Recently Viewed modules installed you MUST uninstall them before upgrading. These plugins have been retired as they're not compatible with the current version of Jomres, if you leave them installed you will end up with blank pages in the frontend. Instead we have produced three new ASAModule plugins called 'ASAModule Popular', 'ASAModule Random' and 'ASAModule Recently Viewed', which are direct replacements for the older plugins, but aren't CMS dependant. To uninstall them use the Joomla Extension Manager first to uninstall the actual plugin, then in the Jomres Plugin Manager -> Third Party Plugins install from there too to remove the plugin's info file.

Along the same vein, we've grouped towns by regions, and have added the region name as a header. We have also added the option to prefilter countries and regions, so to prefilter the countries so that only regions in certain countries are shown in the sidebar you would do something like &prefilter_country_code=GB,FR which will only show regions in the UK and France. Similarly, you can prefilter regions like so : &prefilter_region=Avon which will only show towns in the county of Avon. Because Avon is in the UK, no other countries will be shown.","state":"ui-state-default","title":"Ajax search composite updated.","url":"","url_text":""}]
